    # ============================================================================
    # GABAGOOL22 REVERSE-ENGINEERED STRATEGY
    # ============================================================================
    # Based on continuous ingestion (Dec 14+ 2025)
    #
    # KEY FINDINGS:
    # - Markets: BTC + ETH ONLY, 15min + 1hour Up/Down
    # - Timing: 15m series trades span most of the 0..15m lifetime (with a tilt to 10–15m);
    #          1h series trades span 0..60m (median ~35m).
    # - Execution: maker quoting at bid + occasional taker top-ups on the lagging leg
    #   (FAST_TOP_UP / TOP_UP) to complete hedges quickly when fills are asynchronous.

      # ============================================================================

      # The edge is: 1.0 - (bid_up + bid_down), typically 0.01-0.02 when WS TOB is fresh

      # IMPORTANT: Initial research showed DOWN bias was profitable, but this was
      # sample-period dependent (BTC dropped ~5% during Dec 14-18 observation).
      # Gabagool22's actual strategy is MARKET-NEUTRAL complete-set arbitrage.
      # The edge comes from pricing inefficiencies, NOT from predicting direction.
      # Keep disabled until we have data across both up AND down market regimes.
