-- STRATEGY VALIDATION V2 (with Taker Mode)
-- =============================================================================
-- CONFIGURATION: Replace 'TARGET_USER' with the Polymarket username you want
-- to analyze. Run: sed -i 's/TARGET_USER/actual_username/g' this_file.sql
-- =============================================================================
-- Purpose: Validate strategy matching including both maker AND taker fills
--
-- Changes from v1:
--   1. Fixed floating-point precision issue (>= 0.0099 instead of >= 0.01)
--   2. Added taker mode logic - we take at ask when edge < 1.5% and spread tight
--   3. Match classification now includes MAKER_MATCH and TAKER_MATCH
